# Network Vulnerability Scanner

This is a Python-based network vulnerability scanner that uses Nmap to scan for open ports on a given target IP address. The tool allows users to quickly identify open ports and potential vulnerabilities on the target machine.


## Features
- Scans for open ports (1-1024).
- Provides details about services running on those ports.
- Lists services running on open ports.
- Easy to use with Python and Nmap integration.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x(for me it was 3.12 as I upgraded my linux)
- Nmap installed on the system.[Download Nmap](https://nmap.org/download.html)
- Python `nmap` library. Install it using:
  ```bash
  pip install python-nmap
  ```
## How to Run
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python3 scanner.py
   ```
3. Enter the IP address you want to scan when prompted.
   ```bash
   Enter the IP address to scan: 192.168.1.1
   ```
4. The script will output a list of open ports and services running on those ports.
